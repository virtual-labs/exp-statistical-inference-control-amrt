        "a": "To allow direct access to individual records",
        "b": "To provide summarized information using aggregate queries",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Statistical databases do not allow direct access to individual records.",
        "b": "Statistical databases return summarized results such as COUNT, SUM, and AVERAGE to protect individual privacy.",
        "c": "Encryption is a separate security mechanism and not the primary purpose here.",

        "a": "Brute-force attacks target passwords, not statistical queries.",

        "c": "Inference attacks deduce sensitive information from aggregate query outputs.",

        "a": "This relates to performance issues, not inference.",

      "question": "How does noise addition help prevent inference attacks?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By blocking all aggregate queries",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Noise addition does not block queries entirely.",
        "b": "Encryption is not the mechanism used in noise addition.",
        "c": "Noise addition adds small random values so attackers cannot obtain exact results.",
        "d": "Database size does not affect inference attacks directly."

    {
      "question": "What is the main role of k-anonymity (query-set-size control)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To ensure each query returns exactly k results",
        "b": "To allow queries only when the result set size is at least k",
        "c": "To encrypt k records in the database",
        "d": "To limit the number of users accessing the database"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The result size does not have to be exactly k.",
        "b": "k-anonymity blocks or suppresses results when the query set size is smaller than k.",
        "c": "k-anonymity does not involve encryption.",
        "d": "This is related to access control, not k-anonymity."

    {
      "question": "Why is rate limiting effective against inference attacks?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases query execution speed",
        "b": "It encrypts all query results",
        "c": "It restricts repeated or rapid execution of queries",
        "d": "It allows unlimited access to aggregate queries"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Rate limiting does not affect speed.",
        "b": "Rate limiting does not encrypt data.",
        "c": "Inference attacks rely on repeated queries, which rate limiting prevents.",
        "d": "Unlimited access would increase inference risk."
