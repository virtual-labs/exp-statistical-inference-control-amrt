    {
      "question": "Why can aggregate queries still cause privacy issues in statistical databases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because aggregate queries always expose individual records",
        "b": "Because attackers can combine multiple query results to infer private data",
        "c": "Because aggregate queries are slower to execute",
        "d": "Because aggregate queries modify the database"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Aggregate queries do not directly expose individual records.",
        "b": "Carefully constructed aggregate queries can be compared to infer sensitive individual information.",
        "c": "Query speed is unrelated to privacy leakage.",
        "d": "Aggregate queries only read data and do not modify it."

    {
      "question": "What happens when noise addition is applied to aggregate query results?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Exact query results are returned every time",
        "b": "Queries are completely blocked",
        "c": "Small random variations are introduced into the results",
        "d": "Only encrypted values are returned"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Noise addition prevents exact results from being returned.",
        "b": "Noise addition does not block queries entirely.",
        "c": "Adding controlled randomness makes precise inference unreliable.",
        "d": "Noise addition is different from encryption."

    {
      "question": "If a query result includes fewer records than the threshold k, what should the system do?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Return the result with a warning",
        "b": "Increase the result value automatically",
        "c": "Suppress or block the query output",
        "d": "Store the result for later access"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Warnings alone do not prevent inference attacks.",
        "b": "Automatically increasing values would distort data incorrectly.",
        "c": "Query-set-size control blocks results that involve too few records.",

        "a": "Noise Addition",

        "c": "Rate Limiting",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Noise addition modifies results, not query frequency.",
        "b": "k-anonymity controls result set size, not query count.",
        "c": "Rate limiting restricts repeated or rapid query execution.",
        "d": "Differencing attack is a threat, not a defense."

    {
      "question": "Why are differencing attacks dangerous in statistical databases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They delete records from the database",
        "b": "They exploit differences between similar queries to reveal private data",
        "c": "They slow down the database server",
        "d": "They bypass authentication mechanisms"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Differencing attacks do not modify or delete data.",
        "b": "By comparing query results, attackers can infer sensitive information.",
        "c": "Performance impact is not the main concern here.",
        "d": "Authentication is not directly involved in differencing attacks."

      "question": "What is the main goal of statistical inference control mechanisms?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To eliminate the need for aggregate queries",
        "b": "To improve database performance",
        "c": "To prevent leakage of individual information from aggregate results",
        "d": "To allow unrestricted access to statistical data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Aggregate queries are still useful and allowed.",
        "b": "Performance improvement is not the primary goal.",
        "c": "Inference control aims to protect individual privacy from aggregate query misuse.",
        "d": "Unrestricted access increases privacy risks."
